    "A common problem in high-availability systems is how much resources to provide: how to ensure stability reducing the spending? A solution is auto-scaling: a system component that increases or decreases de amount of resources used by the system according to the current needs. But for that, we need to have an idea of how many requests will arrive. This is an interesting problem to model statistically.\n",

    "Consider an employee portal. It is almost never accessed outside the work hours. During working hours , it usually has a predictably mild number of access during most of the workdays of the month. In the last working day of month, however, it have a spike of access from employees looking for correcting clock-in registrations that may be missing. Then, on the latest working day before or equal to 5, there is another spike, since employees receive their payment this day and want to check their payslip.\n",

    "If we consider access in general as defined by a Poisson process, we can consider choosing a nonhomogeneous Poisson distribution.\n",

    "Let's consider a scenario where we have 1 request per five minutes outside office hours. IN office hours, we have around 100 request per minute, except on the last day of the month, when it goes to 800 requests per minute, and on day 5, when it goes to 500 requests per minute. In this case, the rate function $\\lambda$ responds for the day of the month:"
